# Big picture first (otherwise everything feels random)

Goal of the course
Build a decentralized, content-addressable, distributed file storage system in Go, from scratch.

Translation:

No central server

Files are identified by hash, not filename

Data lives across multiple nodes

Nodes talk directly to each other (P2P)

Can handle and stream large files

Think: “mini IPFS, but educational and explicit.”

## So… what does P2P actually do in this project?

Short answer:

P2P is the nervous system of the distributed filesystem.

Longer, precise answer:

P2P is responsible for:

Listening for incoming nodes

Dialing outbound nodes

Managing connections

Identifying peers

Performing handshakes

Reading and writing messages

Decoupling network code from storage logic

P2P is NOT responsible for:

Storing files

Hashing content

Deciding where files live

Chunking logic

Business rules

That separation is deliberate and professional.

One sentence mental model (keep this)

P2P answers “how nodes talk,” storage answers “what they say.”

If you understand that, the repo stops feeling chaotic.
